<p>I am pleased to annouce the launch of rockit.dev!</p>
<p>In the end of august I was looking for a developer conference to attend. My employer pays for up to two conference visits in the year and it's been a while since I attended one. Last conference I attended was the W-Jax in Munich in 2017.</p>
<p>While looking for conferences, I didn't really found a good overview. I found a couple of lists aggregated by users on Github. And you know how developers think: &quot;I should built that.&quot;. So during the last three months I built rockit.dev</p>
<p><a href="https://rockit.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rockit.dev<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> gives an overview about conferences, workshops, talks and speakers. To get started, I integrated 11 conferences, but I plan to add a lot more.</p>
<p>I plan on adding a lot more development related stuff. Books from speakers, podcasts, hackathons, meetups, ...</p>
<p>I also got to try a couple of new technologies. The backend is built using Spring Boot, Kotlin, Postgres and GraphQL. The frontend is built using NuxtJS, Vue, TypeScript and Bulma.</p>
<p>I would love to get feedback!</p>
